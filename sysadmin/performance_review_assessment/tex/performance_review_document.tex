\section*{Introduction}
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate your working practices.  We want to see that you are working like a sysadmin should.  The assesment has three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item  \textbf{Self assessment:}  You will evaluate your own performance and provide evidence to support your claims;
  \item  \textbf{Peer assessment:}  You will evaluate your team members using the same measures that you used for your self assessment;
  \item  \textbf{Lecturer assessment:}  The lecturer will evaluate and comment on your performance.
\end{enumerate}

Note that on the self and peer assessments, your marks are based on how complete, accurate, and well supported your assessments are.

\section*{Marking schedule}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 10 - Insightful and accurate assessment of performance supported by ample clear evidence.
  \item 7 - Accurate assessment of performance well supported by evidence.
