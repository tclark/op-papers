\section {Scary stories}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Anthem breach}

	About two weeks ago the health insurance company Anthem 
	announced a security breach that exposed sensitive personal
	information about up to 80 million people.  Costs to Anthem 
	are projected to exceed \$100 million USD.

	\frametitle{Target credit card leak}

	During the Christmas shopping season, the American retailer Target's
	credit card payment system was compromised.  Target's costs related
	to this event are expected to be in the billions of dollars.

	\vspace{10mm}
	Interestingly, Target had a strong security system in place at the time.

	\frametitle{Not so new vulnerabilities}

	A 15 year old bug present in all versions of Windows allows 
	remote execution of malicious code.

	\frametitle{Facebook API flaw}

	A programmer identified a vulnerability in a Facebook API
	that allowed remote deletion of any photos.

	\vspace{10mm}
	Facebook paid a \$12,500 USD bounty and fixed the bug.

\section{Course information}
%----------- slide --------------------------------------------------%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Course goals}

 \begin{itemize}
  \item This paper will not make you a security expert.
  \item Instead, we're trying to acquire a baseline level of \emph{security literacy}
	  that every IT professional should have.
  \item To put it very prosaically, this paper is about ``what you need to 
	  know about security to avoid screwing up your third year project.''
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Course delivery}
	
	We will examine a set of security vulnerabilities.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We will see how to exploit them.
		\item We will determine their causes.
		\item We wiil see how to fix them.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Course delivery}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item We can't look at every possible security problem.
		\item Our intention is to get some experience thinking about
			and solving security issues.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Assessments}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Your assessments will be a series of assignments issued 
			approximately weekly.
		\item There is about a 60/40 split between programming and
			sysadmin assigments.
		\item In some cases  the distinction will seem a bit arbitrary.
			Life is funny that way.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{The problem of security}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Start at the beginning}
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item Suppose that you're working on a IT development project.
	    \item What is the process you will follow?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What about security?}

	Where, in your project lifecycle, does security come in?

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Maintenance?}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What about security?}

	Where, in your project lifecycle, does security come in?

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maintenance
		\item \textbf{Acceptance testing?}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What about security?}

	Where, in your project lifecycle, does security come in?

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maintenance
		\item Acceptance testing
		\item \textbf{Code review?}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}

		\item \textbf{Coding?}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What about security?}

	Where, in your project lifecycle, does security come in?

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maintenance
		\item Acceptance testing
		\item Code review
		\item Unit testing
		\item Coding
		\item Specification
		\item \textbf{Requirements analysis?}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What about security?}

	Security is a consideration at \emph{every} phase of the project
	lifecycle, and this means that \emph{everybody} needs to be 
	security literate.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maintenance
		\item Acceptance testing
		\item Code review
		\item Unit testing
		\item Coding
		\item Specification
		\item Requirements analysis
	\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Security as a feature}

    ``Engage in security early and often and be sure to have it included in your definition of done.''

    \end{frame}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Getting started with security}

	Make security part of your project from the start by identifying risks.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Look for components of the project where
			failures would be particularly harmful.
		\item Look for processes in your project where security
			problems are more likely.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
