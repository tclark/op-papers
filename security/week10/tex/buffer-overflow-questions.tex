\section*{Instructions}
Answer the questions below and submit a hard copy in class on Monday, 11 May.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item When we performed our buffer overflow tests, why did we use ``aaaabbbbccccdddd... yyyyzzzz'' for our input string?  Why not just use a string with one repeated character?
	\vspace{40mm}
	\item When we performed our attack, why did we use the bytes produced by compiling and loading our
	assembly language code?
	\vspace{40mm}
	\item In our exploit input, what was the significance of the \texttt{\textbackslash{}x90} characters?
	\vspace{40mm}
	\item We overwrote the return address value as part of our exploit.  What was located at the addess we inserted?
\end{enumerate}
